# PythonProject_ExploratoryDataAnalysis
In this project, we uncover insights into **unicorn companies**â€“companies that are valued at over one billion dollars.  

We work with a dataset about unicorn companies, discovering characteristics of the data, structuring the data in ways that will help  draw meaningful insights, and using visualizations to analyze the data. Ultimately, we will draw conclusions about what significant trends or patterns are found in the dataset.
